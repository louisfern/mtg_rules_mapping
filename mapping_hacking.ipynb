       " '100.2. To play, each player needs his or her own deck of traditional Magic cards, small items to represent any tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '100.2a In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates his or her own deck ahead of time), each deck must contain at least sixty cards. A constructed deck may contain any number of basic land cards and no more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '100.2b In limited play (a way of playing in which each player gets the same quantity of unopened Magic product such as booster packs and creates his or her own deck using only this product and basic land cards), each deck must contain at least forty cards. A limited deck may contain as many duplicates of a card as are included with the product.\\n',\n",

       " '100.4a In constructed play, a sideboard may contain no more than fifteen cards. The four-card limit (see rule 100.2a) applies to the combined deck and sideboard.\\n',\n",

       " '100.4d In limited play involving other multiplayer team variants, each card in a team’s card pool but not in any player’s deck is assigned to the sideboard of one of those players. Each player has his or her own sideboard; cards may not be transferred between players.\\n',\n",

       " '100.6. Most Magic tournaments (organized play activities where players compete against other players to win prizes) have additional rules covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents). These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring all cards from some older sets.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '101.1. Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time (see rule 104.3a).\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '101.2. When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it can’t happen, the “can’t” effect takes precedence.\\n',\n",
       " 'Example: If one effect reads “You may play an additional land this turn” and another reads “You can’t play land cards this turn,” the effect that precludes you from playing lands wins.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '101.2a Adding abilities to objects and removing abilities from objects don’t fall under this rule. (See rule 112.10.)\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '101.3. Any part of an instruction that’s impossible to perform is ignored. (In many cases the card will specify consequences for this; if it doesn’t, there’s no effect.)\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '101.4. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player seated to the active player’s left) makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the “Active Player, Nonactive Player (APNAP) order” rule.\\n',\n",
       " 'Example: A card reads “Each player sacrifices a creature.” First, the active player chooses a creature he or she controls. Then each of the nonactive players, in turn order, chooses a creature he or she controls. Then all creatures chosen this way are sacrificed simultaneously.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '101.4a If an effect has each player choose a card in a hidden zone, such as his or her hand or library, those cards may remain face down as they’re chosen. However, each player must clearly indicate which face-down card he or she is choosing.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '101.4c If a player would make more than one choice at the same time, the player makes the choices in the order written, or in the order he or she chooses if the choices aren’t ordered.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '101.4d If a choice made by a nonactive player causes the active player, or a different nonactive player earlier in the turn order, to have to make a choice, APNAP order is restarted for all outstanding choices.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '102. Players\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '102.1. A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other players are nonactive players.\\n',\n",

       " '102.2. In a two-player game, a player’s opponent is the other player.\\n',\n",

       " '102.3. In a multiplayer game between teams, a player’s teammates are the other players on his or her team, and the player’s opponents are all players not on his or her team.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103. Starting the Game\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.1. At the start of a game, each player shuffles his or her deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut his or her opponents’ decks. The players’ decks become their libraries.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.1a If a player is using a sideboard (see rule 100.4) or cards being represented by checklist cards (see rule 713), those cards are set aside before shuffling.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.1b In a Commander game, each player puts his or her commander from his or her deck face up into the command zone before shuffling. See rule 903.6.\\n',\n",

       " '103.1c In a Conspiracy Draft game, each player puts any number of conspiracy cards from his or her sideboard into the command zone before shuffling. See rule 905.4.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.2. After the decks have been shuffled, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn. In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The game’s default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.2a In a game using the shared team turns option, there is a starting team rather than a starting player.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.2b In an Archenemy game, these methods aren’t used to determine who takes the first turn. Rather, the archenemy takes the first turn.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.2c One card (Power Play) states that its controller is the starting player. This effect supersedes these methods.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.3. Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different starting life totals.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.3a In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team’s starting life total is 30.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.3b In a Vanguard game, each player’s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of his or her vanguard card.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.4. Each player draws a number of cards equal to his or her starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some effects can modify a player’s starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with his or her initial hand may take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether or not he or she will take a mulligan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles his or her hand back into his or her library, then draws a new hand of one fewer cards than he or she had before. If a player kept his or her hand of cards, those cards become the player’s opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. (Note that if a player’s hand size reaches zero cards, that player must keep that hand.) After all players have kept an opening hand, each player in turn order whose hand contains fewer cards than that player’s starting hand size may look at the top card of his or her library. If a player does, that player may put that card on the bottom of his or her library.\\n',\n",

       " '103.4b If an effect allows a player to perform an action “any time [that player] could mulligan,” the player may perform that action at a time he or she would declare whether or not he or she will take a mulligan. This need not be in the first round of mulligans. Other players may have already made their mulligan declarations by the time the player has the option to perform this action. If the player performs the action, he or she then declares whether or not he or she will take a mulligan.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '103.4c In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws a new hand of as many cards as he or she had before. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.\\n',\n",

       " '103.4d In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team declares whether or not he or she will take a mulligan, then the players on each other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time.
